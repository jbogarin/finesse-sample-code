   The Silent Monitored sample gadget is intended to serve as an example of 
   giving an Agent a visible indication that they are being Silent Monitored.
   This is a legal requirement in some countries and by default the Finesse
   Desktop does not show this.  However, as this sample shows, you can write
   a Gadget that gives your agents this capability.
       
   This is only a sample and is NOT intended to be a production quality
   gadget and will not be supported as such.  It is NOT guaranteed to
   be bug free. It is merely provided as a guide for a programmer to see
   how to initialize a gadget and set up handlers for user and dialog updates and
   performing a makecall.
   
   The sample contains the following files:
   
      FinesseJavaScriptLibrary/
         readme.txt
      SilentMonitored/
         SilentMonitored.css
         SilentMonitored.js
         SilentMonitored.xml

   This gadget sample is made available to Cisco partners and customers as
   a convenience to help minimize the cost of Cisco Finesse customizations.
